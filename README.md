## Adam Taranto

I'm a research software engineer, genome biologist, and educator who helps researchers of all levels
improve their computer science and data science skills.

#### üë©‚Äçüíª What I'm currently working on

- [tanghaibao/jcvi](https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi) - Python library to facilitate genome assembly, annotation, and comparative genomics (4 days ago)
- [flexidot-bio/flexidot](https://github.com/flexidot-bio/flexidot) - Highly customizable, ambiguity-aware dotplots for visual sequence analyses (5 days ago)
- [WEHI-Education/Workshop-IntroToHPC-Slurm](https://github.com/WEHI-Education/Workshop-IntroToHPC-Slurm) - RCP Training introducing HPC concepts and SLURM (2 weeks ago)
- [WEHI-Education/Workshop-intermediate-slurm](https://github.com/WEHI-Education/Workshop-intermediate-slurm) - Intermedate Slurm Workshop source code using the Software Carpentry Workbench style. (2 weeks ago)
- [Adamtaranto/deRIP2](https://github.com/Adamtaranto/deRIP2) - Reconstruct ancestral state sequences of fungal repeat families by correcting for RIP-like mutations. Mask RIP or deamination events from alignments. (1 month ago)
