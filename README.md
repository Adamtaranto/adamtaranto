## Adam Taranto

I'm a research software engineer, genome biologist, and educator who helps researchers of all levels
improve their computer science and data science skills.

#### üë©‚Äçüíª What I'm currently working on

- [Adamtaranto/deRIP2](https://github.com/Adamtaranto/deRIP2) - Reconstruct ancestral state sequences of fungal repeat families by correcting for RIP-like mutations. Mask RIP or deamination events from alignments. (today)
- [WEHI-Education/CarpentriesSlides](https://github.com/WEHI-Education/CarpentriesSlides) - Converts Carpentries workbench workshops to slides (3 days ago)
- [WEHI-Education/Workshop-intermediate-slurm](https://github.com/WEHI-Education/Workshop-intermediate-slurm) - Intermedate Slurm Workshop source code using the Software Carpentry Workbench style. (3 days ago)
- [Adamtaranto/TE-splitter](https://github.com/Adamtaranto/TE-splitter) - Extract terminal repeats from retrotransposons (LTRs) or DNA transposons (TIRs). Compose synthetic MITES from complete DNA transposons. (4 days ago)
- [Adamtaranto/mimeo](https://github.com/Adamtaranto/mimeo) - Scan genomes for internally repeated sequences, elements which are repetitive in another species, or high-identity HGT candidate regions between species. (4 days ago)
